# Python_Challenge

PyBank

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating and generating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of Pybank. I refered to the financial data located under resources caled budget_data.csv for Pybank. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll

In the second part of this challenge, I am tasked to look closer into the election data of Pypoll. I refered to the election data located under resources called election_data.csv for Pypoll. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.
